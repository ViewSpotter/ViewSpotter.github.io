<h2> Why Is Health Important And What to do?</h2>
<p>
Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle. 
Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. 
<BR>Feeling good about yourself and taking care of your health are important for your self-esteem and self-image.
 Maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body.</p>
<p>
Now You may be asking how do you maintain a healthy Lifestyle?
Part of it is just keeping away from extra greasy foods or high sugar foods.
<br>This can be quite the task if you undertake it all at once as your diet can differ greatly than what I will outline.
<br>My advice would be to not change your Daily Lifestyle all at once but in increments as it will keep you from burnning out or getting sick.
<br>How would you get sick? Changes in diet can cause your body to get sick simply because its not used to processing certain foods.

<h3> Steps To Attain A Healthy Lifestyle</h3>
<p> Some steps as forementioned above are to eat less of certain items but also to allow for exercise/
<br> Now I would suggest to start with the change of diet first as you will see the results faster that way.
<br> You may start to notice a drop in weight and also find a boost in your energy levels.
<br> I know some may wonder if eating less has to happen as a whole in food but no actually!
<br> You can eat a lot but try instead more filling foods that are extra nutritious! 
<br> Ill leave some foods to get you started. ( Chicken Breast, Fish, Greek Yogurt and Veggies)
</p>
<p>Well now we have the quote on quote diet plan set and its time to move on to incorporating a bit of exercise.
<br>Try to picture what your end goal is before you start any form of exercise and let it guide you, For example:
Do you want to lose weight, have more energy or maybe you just want to feel stronger? Once you have that figured out you can start planning out your steps to improve.
<br> So when you start out, try not to hit the gym 5 days a week for an hour or two as that can lead to burnout so quickly!
<br> Instead maybe try walking everyday for ten minutes or lifting weights two days a week for 15 to 30 minutes.
<br> The build up is just as important as the end goal! Once you have say three weeks in your new regiment, than you will add more to it.</p>
